A game about pushing bubbles to pop out of the arena.

This is an AR multiplayer game. Made in Global Game Jam 2025 @Â Sun & Moon Lair. 
Made with Unity 6 using AR Foundation and NetCode with GameObjects.
This is my first attempt combining them to create a AR MP game.
Code is awful ofc, but it's a jam, c'mon!

Joke's aside, this was a good start for me to understand AR and MP better.

Important notes:
- MP sync with AR is horrible. I tried to synchronize objects by using local positions. The problem is related to spawning the platform.
- I removed the Unity services connection before pushing the files. So, you need to connect it to the Unity dashboard to use their servers
- Because of using the Unity servers, the latency is bad too.
