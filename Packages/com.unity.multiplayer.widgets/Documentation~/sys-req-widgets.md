# Requirements and compatibility

This page outlines the minimum requirements your project needs to meet to use the Multiplayer Widgets package on all supported platforms.

## Compatibility

The Multiplayer Widgets package is compatible with Unity versions 6 and later.

## Requirements
The Multiplayer Widgets package requires the [Multiplayer Services package](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/mps-sdk/manual). Unity automatically installs this package with the Multiplayer Widgets package. 

Follow the instructions in [Get started with UGS](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/overview/manual/getting-started) to set up your project for Multiplayer services.
  
## Recommendations

To test multiplayer widget behavior, install the [Multiplayer Play Mode package](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/install/). Use this package to create a virtual player to connect to a session.
